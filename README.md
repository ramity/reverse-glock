# Digitally Reverse Engineering a G19 Gen 6

Glock.com has a neat 3d viewer that provides 120 photos.

The goal is to apply photogrametry to those photos to create a 3d model of the pistol.

## Steps

1. Generate the URL set
2. Download the photos
3. Generate the 3D model

## Tools

- [Firefox](https://firefox.com)
- [Meshroom](https://alicevision.org/)

## Results

Initial low effort prototype using meshroom's "photogrametry + object turntable" pipeline.
